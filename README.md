# Trend Identification using Power BI
## Overview
The system also leverages Power BI for trend identification using concepts of support, lift, and confidence. This approach helps in finding the most preferred combinations based on customer purchase data, thereby providing insights to build more accurate and personalized product recommendation systems.

## PROs:
- Deeper insights into customer purchasing behaviors
- Optimized inventory management
- Enhanced marketing strategies
- Identification of most preferred combinations
- Forecasting purchase behaviors, identification of cross-selling and up-selling opportunities

## Desirable Enhancements:
- Streaming data integration for real-time analysis and insights

## Example Scenario
A customer buying cornflakes might prefer buying milk along with it. Similarly, someone purchasing a dress for an event might want the entire look (top to bottom) done.
